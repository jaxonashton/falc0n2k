I always craved delicious design and had a fetish for minimalism. 

GUIs have their place, but I'll take a command line anyday. Throughout my life, I've evangelized technology through social media, blogging, podcasting and just about any other creative medium you can think of. I have coded, hacked, tweaked and patched my way through WordPress, Ghost, PHP, JS, HTML, CSS, Sass, Git, Linux, macOS and Windows. 

I'm great at breaking things and even better at fixing them. In previous lives, I was the co-founder of the tech news site IndyGeek, and a former Comcaster who worked at the intersection of customer experience and social media strategy. Now, I provide cloud infrastructure support for the financial sector, [work on photography](https://mulberryphotowerx.com), and dabble in some [tech projects](https://github.com/JaxonAshton?tab=repositories) in my spare time.
